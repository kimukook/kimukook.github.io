<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>I'm a PhD graduate (summer 2025) in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC San Diego, with a specialization in Computational Sciences
  I worked in <a ref="https://www.ucsdrobotics.org">Flow and Control lab</a> under the guidance of <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu">Prof Thomas R. Bewley</a>.
  My research primarily focuses on <strong>adaptive observation</strong>â€”designing algorithms that adaptively control and direct 
  autonomous agents (such as UAVs or robots) as they observe and interact with complex, uncertain environments. My work blends numerical simulation, 
  stochastic dynamics, and optimization techniques to tackle real-world challenges.</p>
<p>My research interests include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Probabilistic search theory</li>
    <li>PDE-constrained optimal control</li>
    <li>Ensemble-based adaptive observation</li>
    <li>Numerical analysis and computation</li>
    <li>Surrogate-based derivative-free optimization</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  I'm currently working on projects involving environmental monitoring, adversarial search, and safety-critical control in aerial systems.

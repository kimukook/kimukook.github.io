<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>I'm a PhD graduate (summer 2025) in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC San Diego, with a specialization in 
  Computational Sciences. I worked in <a ref="https://www.ucsdrobotics.org">Flow and Control lab</a> under the guidance of <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu">Prof Thomas R. Bewley</a>.
  My research primarily focuses on <em><strong>adaptive observation</strong></em>â€”designing control algorithms that adaptively 
  direct autonomous agents (such as UAVs or robots) as they interact (observe, search, or even put out wildfires...) with complex, uncertain environments. 
  My work blends numerical simulation,  stochastic dynamics, and optimization techniques to tackle real-world challenges.</p>
<p>My research interests include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Probabilistic search theory</li>
    <li>PDE-constrained optimal control</li>
    <li>Ensemble-based adaptive observation</li>
    <li>Numerical analysis and computation</li>
    <li>Surrogate-based derivative-free optimization</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>
I'm actively looking for postdoc positions where I can design theoretical control algorithms to solve real-world problems.

abstract: "This paper proposes a Control Lyapunov Function-based Quadratic Program (CLF-QP) approach for controlling a cable-driven parallel robot. We consider the cable-driven boat motion simulator to verify that the CLF-QP approach controls platform motions following the desired trajectories and optimizes cable tensions in the desired boundaries. A simulation model with a moving platform and 8 cables was used for testing CLF-QP controller. 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) periodic and mathematical ship model motion were applied to the simulation. The results show that the normalized root mean square errors(NRMSE) of motion tracking were less than 7%, and cable tensions were bounded in the range set by a user without constraint violations in optimization processes."
